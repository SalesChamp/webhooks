# Introduction

This package provides utilities required for signing and authenticating calls to public URLs.

## Usage

### Verifying and signing requests

`SalesChamp\Webhooks\Authenticator::sign` expects raw HTTP request body as argument in order to provide a signature used for authentication, `SalesChamp\Webhooks\Authenticator::verify` expects signature received in `X-SalesChamp-Signature` HTTP header and raw HTTP request body in order to verify the request.

### Data manipulation

`SalesChamp\Webhooks\Data` represents a crate with documentation describing data attached to webhook requests. This class should not be created manually, but rather generated by factories. Example of such implementation can be found in `SalesChamp\Webhooks\NetteBridge\DataFactory` made specifically for [Nette Framework](https://doc.nette.org/en/2.4/http-request-response).

## Tests

Can be run via `./runTests.sh`.

## Versioning

Library follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). Make sure to update to tag commits accordingly.
